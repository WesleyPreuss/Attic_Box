Project Background
This is my mini project for the data engineering programme
We have been tasked with designing a shop application to keep track of products, orders and couriers


Client requirements
To create,edit,delete products,orders and couriers
To persist data


How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?
I designed a user friendly interface and menu system imagining that someone would have to use the product
I implemented menus and functions to handle the requirements of the spec
I persisted the data to a json 


How did you guarantee the project's requirements?
Performed regular manual testing to ensure that functionality was maintained and prevent regression
Handled errors to ensure application functionality


If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?
spec specified CSV but i implemented JSON
Implement automated unit tests
implement sql database 


What did you most enjoy implementing?
I thing i enjoyed implementing the most was the functions as i enjoy thinking of the different ways to implement the logic

!!!edit for action test!!!
